## Overview and Origin:
In a banking institution, the term Cash Management refers to the day-to-day administration of managing cash inflows and outflows. Because of the multitude of cash transactions on a daily basis, they must be managed. The ultimate goal of cash management is to maximize liquidity and minimize the cost of funds.
